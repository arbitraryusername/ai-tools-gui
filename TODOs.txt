SERVER
- add some code guidelines to prompt, like "ensure business rules and assumptions are not duplicated"
- add endpoints to express server:
  - revertLastCommit()

CLIENT 
- add button to undo the commit (only on most recent commit)
- allow users to pick which folders/files are included in each submit
- capture javascript runtime errors and automatically propose solutions
- add ability to define a prompt context, where the user can select specific commits,
  which will update the selected files list to be files only from those commits.
  based on these selected commits, prompt recommendations can be generated for next steps
  as well as suggestions for code improvements
- could have toggle that explains the changes, but this is just nice to have at this point
- tabs of repos along the left side, tabs of tasks for the current repo along the top
- each task is like a new thread, meaning we keep context of previous messages
- after the first message in a task, the user is shown three options for the next prompt,
  and the user can edit this before submitting. this saves on many keystrokes, and makes this
  much more practical to use on mobile devices! 
- could have a refactor/improvement mode vs a new feature mode, which have different
  UI and/or different workflows.
